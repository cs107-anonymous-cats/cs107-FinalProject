What tasks has each group member been assigned to for Milestone2.

Our group met over the weekend to discuss the work breakdown structure and project extensions. We decided to add a reverse mode implementation for the extension.

Hannah: I will work on implementing the trignometric functions for single input scalar functions (add, subtract, divide, multiply), implementing logarithmic functions (exp, pow, sqrt, etc.), and writing test cases for these functions. I will also start on creating a skeleton that is compatible with multiple inputs, along with their test cases. 
Jie: Implementation details (documentation for forward and reverse mode implementation)
Taro: implementation of minimum requirements(dual numbers)
Zach: how to use (how to download the package, setting up PyPI, how to use the package, how to distribute and deliver the package, give use cases). software organization. Test suite (work with Hannah and Taro)


What has each group member done since the submission of Milestone1.

Each member updated the milestone1 file based on the feedbacks. 

Hannah: Since the submission of Milestone 1, I went to office hours to discuss the implementation of feedback with a TF and added graphics for the chain rule and computational graphs in the milestone 1 document and summarized everyone's implemented feedback for each section of the milestone. I also met with my groupmmates to discuss the work breakdown to complete milestone 2.

Qn: do we use codecov? do we edit the intro and background. what goes into the how to use piece. what's in software organization? what's in the future features
