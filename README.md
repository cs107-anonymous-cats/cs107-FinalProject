## Description

This package implements the automatic differentiation. This is important for complex computational problems, including optimization.

## Current Version

**autodiff 0.1.2**

## Broader Impact and Inclusivity

#### Broader Impact
One of the primary uses for a package like **autodiff** is to help with deep/machine learning modeling, especially when gradient-based
optimization is involved. With these models, computing derivatives becomes a highly complicated affair with respect to symbolic
and numerical differentiation, but automatic differentiation relieves much of that difficulty while being efficient and precise.
As such, the positive impacts of **autodiff** are much like the positive impacts of other packages such as TensorFlow that utilize
automatic differentiation. Positive impacts include better, safer, and faster processing AI for self driving cars, search engines, and
healthcare technology. Negative impacts include possible reinforcement of discriminatory facial recognition, more invasive advertisements,
and more advanced scamming tools. It is up to the users of **autodiff** to make responsible decisions for where and how automatic
differentiation is to be implemented in their own projects, and our hope is that their goals for more positive impacts are the same as
ours.

#### Inclusivity
Our **autodiff** package is open-source and in a public git repository such that anyone with a computer and internet access should be able
to both use and contribute to our project. Our hope is that as long as such resources are available, individuals and organizations that
come from all backgrounds and identities will be able to be positively impacted by our package and will be able to contribute to our code
to make their own positive impacts. There are challenges to this, as there are certain other expectations for those who want to be able
to work on the project. This includes a proficiency in the english language and Python as a programming language, as all code is written
in python and all docstrings written with english speakers in mind. Pull requests are handled on a case by case basis, with the general
procedure being that pull requests concerning adding text or code can be self-approved, but removing or altering requires approval from
the other contributors. All pull requests are reviewed in either case and of course can be reverted if necessary, similar to how Wikipedia
operates. This ensures that anyone can contribute if they have something to offer but negative contributions can be filtered out.
